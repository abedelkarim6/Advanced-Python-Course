# AI Startup Pitch Generator

## 🎯 Project Goal  
Build a Streamlit app that helps students turn a problem idea into a **validated startup pitch**, step by step, with Gemini.  

---

## 🛠️ User Steps  
1. **Enter the Problem**  
   - Write a problem you see in real life (e.g., “long waiting times at clinics”).  

2. **Validate the Problem**  
   - Step 1: Ask AI → “What clarifying questions should I answer to refine this problem?”  
   - Step 2: Answer the questions in the app.  
   - Step 3: Ask AI → “Summarize my answers into a clear problem statement.”  

3. **Generate Startup Ideas**  
   - Step 1: Ask AI → “Suggest 3 startup solutions for this problem.”  
   - Step 2: Pick one solution.  
   - Step 3: Ask AI → “Expand this solution into a business model canvas.”  
   - Step 4: Ask AI → “Create a pitch deck outline for me.”  
   - Step 5: Ask AI → “Write me a 30-second elevator pitch.”  

4. **Final Step**  
   - Get a **mini pitch kit**: problem statement + solution + business model + pitch outline + elevator pitch.
