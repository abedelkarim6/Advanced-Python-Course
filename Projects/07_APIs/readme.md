# FastAPI + SQLite Assignment

## Objective
Apply everything you have learned in FastAPI to your SQLite project by creating APIs that interact with your database.

---

## Tasks

### 0. Do the currency_api.py tool code.

### 1. Connect FastAPI to your SQLite database
- Ensure your project has a SQLite database with the tables you designed.
- Set up FastAPI to connect and query the database.

### 2. Implement CRUD APIs
Create endpoints for your main table(s) that allow you to:
- **Create** records (POST)
- **Read** records (GET)
- **Update** records (PUT)
- **Delete** records (DELETE)

### 3. Add Two Custom POST APIs
- Design **2 additional POST APIs** that make sense for your project idea.
- Examples (adapt to your project):
  - Search for records by keyword
  - Bulk insert multiple records

### 4. Test Your APIs
- Test all endpoints to ensure they work correctly.
- Include sample requests and responses for each endpoint.

---

## Deliverables
1. FastAPI project code with all CRUD and custom APIs implemented.
2. SQLite database file with some sample data.
3. (Optional) Screenshots or documentation of API testing.
